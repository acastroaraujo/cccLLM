# cccLLM

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains code to extract information from court rulings using LLMs via the new [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/) package.

For using LLMs like ChatGPT you will have to add something like this to your `.Renviron` file:

```         
OPENAI_API_KEY = "you_api_goes_here"
```

If you don't know where this file is located, you can use the following function:

```         
usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "user")
```

Some documents exceed the maximum context length of 128000 tokens.

These documents were manually coding (with the exception of the English and Spanish summaries) and can be found in the `manual` directory.

## Codebook

1.  `id`: Ruling ID.

    Each ruling has a standardized name. The infix carries no meaning; the suffix indicates the year in which the ruling was made; and the prefix refers to the type of ruling.

    Type of ruling:

    -   `C`. Refers to *sentencia de constitucionalidad,* or the cases in which the CCC decides whether a law, rule, or administrative decision is compatible with constitutional norms.

    -   `T`. Refers to *tutela*, which is an individual complaint mechanism aimed at the protection of fundamental rights (or special protection writ).

    -   `SU`. Refers *sentencia de unificación,* or decisions in which the Court has decided to compile and standardize the decisions made in various `T` rulings.

    [For example: *T-406-92, SU-039-97, C-225-1995, C-776-03, T-025-04, SU-1184-01*]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

2.  `url`: Document address in CCC website.

    [*For example: <https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/1994/c-221-94.htm>*]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

3.  `chamber_raw`: Refers to the parsed non-standardized name of the chamber that authored the ruling.

    [For example: *Sala Séptima de Revisión de Tutelas*, *Sala Plena de Conjueces*]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

4.  `chamber`: Refers to the kind of chamber that authored the ruling, which can be either a three-person chamber (`SR`, *sala de revisión)* or a full-chamber (`SP`, *sala plena).*

5.  `person`:

    -   `name`: Name of judge.

    -   `mp`: Authoring judge *(magistrado ponente).*

    -   `sv`: Dissenting opinion *(salvamento de voto).*

    -   `av`: Concurring opinion *(aclaración de voto).*

    -   `conjuez`: Whether the judge is holds a permanent position in the court or was appointed for this specific ruling. This happens, for example, when one of the judges in the CCC recuses themselves.

    *Note. Most of the time this is a three row data frame in case the chamber composed of a three-person chamber (`SR`) or a nine row data frame in case of full-chamber (`SP`).*

    For example:

    | name                        | av      | sv      | mp      | conjuez |
    |-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
    | `Vladimiro Naranjo Mesa`    | `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `TRUE`  | `FALSE` |
    | `Antonio Barrera Carbonell` | `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `FALSE` |
    | `Alfredo Beltrán Sierra`    | `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `FALSE` |

6.  `articles`: List of articles of the Constitution that are object of discussion.

    [For example: *23, 212, 213, 215*]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

7.  `summary_en`: Two paragraph summary in English.

8.  `summary_es`: Two paragraph summary in Spanish.

9.  `rj`: Refers to *res judicata (cosa juzgada)* and notes whether the court's decision is determined by previous binding rulings or not. This meant to prevent the same constitutional issue from being raised again in future cases.

10. `rj_citation_raw` (only if `rj` is `TRUE`): List of rulings cited as binding.

    [For example: *Sentencia T-406 de 1992, Sentencia C-225/95*]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

11. `rj_citation:` Standardized list of rulings cited as binding.

    [For example: *T-406-92, C-225-95*]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
