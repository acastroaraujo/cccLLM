This package contains a collection of datasets about the Colombian Constitutional Court. Most of them were processed with the help of Large Language Models. It is meant to complement the datasets collected in the [ccc](https://acastroaraujo.github.io/ccc/) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cccLLM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("acastroaraujo/cccLLM")
```

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is:

```{r, comment="", echo=FALSE}
